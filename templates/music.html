                As a year comes to an end, Spotify releases their annual End-of-the-Year breakdown of each user's top charts of the year. Our group was inspired by this product to create a similar analysis, utilizing Apple Music, Spotify, and LastFM API calls to generate current data. Rather than observing an individual's top streaming activity, we decided to dissect through the top charting tracks through an array of countries for comparison.
                <br>
                <br>
                We didn't have explicit questions we wanted answered through our research. We were interested in seeing how varied the different platforms really were, if they were at all. Using Spotify's Audio Features, we also wanted to see if those were contributions of why a track was a big hit and how could future artists use that to get their music charting on national levels. Our main interested boiled down to 'Analysis By':

                We called in data from iTunes, LastFM, and Spotify.
                <br>
                <br>
                We initially were set on using Apple Music, Spotify, and LastFM as our main sources for API calls. However, once we started creating our Jupyter Notebook for data mining and cleaning, we noticed that Apple Music was not free for developers like Spotify and LastFM were. We chose to use an iTunes RSS link formatted in JSON to retrieve the necessary songs per chart.
                <br>
                <br>
                We restricted our data analysis across 9 countries:

              <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
                We started off creating 3 seperate files that took in the request call and outputted a response. For iTunes and LastFM we did not need to create tokens to authorize these calls, but for Spotify we each created a token that contained our Client Key and Client Secret. With the responses generated, we created a dataframe that pulled the Top 5 songs from each region and their attributes, namely: Album, Artist, and Genre.              </p>

                <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
                    After creating each dataframe, we merged them to pull in the playlist ID tag. This tag would allow us to find the Audio Features of each track. Audio features are listed by type as such:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least # danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</li>
                    <li>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</li>
                    <li>Pitch Class = Tonal counterparts: 0=C 1=C♯ 2=D 3=D♯ 4=E 5=F 6=F♯ 7=G 8=G♯ 9=A 10=t or Aor A♯ 11=e or B</li>
                    <li>Loudness - The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.</li>
                    <li>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</li>
                    <li>Accousticness - a confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</li>
                    <li>Instrumentalness - Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.</li>
                    <li>Liveness - Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</li>
                    <li>Valence - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</li>
                </ul>

              <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
                Our main takeaway from this project was our ability to adapt to roadblocks in the data utilize git to our advantage. Our first roadblock was not having access to Apple Music’s developer program. This made us rethink the design of our project and use an RSS link. 
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
                We enhanced our python script to perform faster and efficiently. Implementations of Google Translate and Matplotlib’s FontProperties to make our data readable for us and other users. 
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray-800 mb-6 mb-md-8">
                Using git branches to complete this project allowed us to consolidate our data properly with minimal corruption. Our git strategy is shown below:
